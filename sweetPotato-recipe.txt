Ingredients:
 - 2 healthy bulbs of sweet potatoes
 - 2 cooking spoons of palm-oil
 - Pepper (To your taste)
 - Onions (To your taste)
 - seasoning cubes (To your taste)
 - salt (To your taste)
 - water (1 Litre)

Directions:
  1. Put water in a pot and let it boil.
  2. Peel your bulbs of sweet potatoes, dice into small pieces ,
   	 wash it and put into the pot of boiling water.
  3. Allow it cook for 20 minutes
  4.Then add all the ingredients to taste.
  5. Allow it cook all together until the sweet potatoes are very tender.
	 *(You'll know when they're tender because you'll keep sticking a fork in 
    them until it goes in effortlessly)
  6. Then turn off the heat.
  7. Get a wooden laddle and mash the contents of your pot together until 
      there is no water left in the pot.
      *(Yep, the heat should be turned off when the potatoes are tender, and 
      some liquid is still floating around in the pot.)
      *[Hey, you're going to use oven gloves to hold the pot firmly while you stir 
      and mash. Just incase you didn't know that.]
   8. Serve at whatever temperature desirable.
   9. As a bonus, it's called "Arcutor" in my dialect.
   So, Yay! Arcutor is served!
